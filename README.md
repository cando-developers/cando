# Building Cando 

## Ubuntu 18.X
A CANDO binary can be downloaded from [ThirdLaw Technologies LLC](http://www.thirdlaw.tech/downloads/cando/binaries/ubuntu-18/).

To build CANDO on your native system, please see the state of dependencies for various installations on the [Wiki](https://github.com/cando-developers/cando/wiki).

# CANDO + Jupyter Demonstrations
Several JupyterLab notebooks that demonstrate how CANDO can be used in the realm of computational chemustry can be found in [CANDO-demos](https://github.com/cando-developers/cando-demos).

To run JupyterLab and start a demo:

1. run ```/opt/clasp/bin/cando-jupyter```

2. copy and paste the provided link into a web browser (Firefox is recommended).
