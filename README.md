CANDO - Computer Aided Nanostructure Design and Optimization
============

Cando is a computational chemistry environment for
building and designing functional molecules and materials.

Cando is an extension of the Clasp Common Lisp programming environment (github.com/clasp-developers/clasp).

# Building

Cando needs to be installed within the clasp/extensions directory using the following steps.

1. Clone clasp using: ```git clone https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp.git```
2. Clone cando using:

```
cd clasp/extensions
git clone https://github.com/drmeister/cando.git
```

3. Go to the instructions for building Clasp and follow those - Cando will be built within Clasp.

This will result in Cando being installed within the Clasp source tree at clasp/extensions/cando
