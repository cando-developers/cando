#CANDO - Computer Aided Nanostructure Design and Optimization
============

### FOR REVIEW PURPOSES ONLY - CANDO is currently a lot of trouble to build. Please don't disseminate this or publish on this until I get a chance to clean things up.

Cando is a computational chemistry environment for
building and designing functional molecules and materials.
It's currently being designed to prepare calculations for the Amber molecular dynamics package and to develop modeling tools for the foldamer community.

It runs within the Clasp Common Lisp programming environment (github.com/drmeister/clasp).

It needs to be installed within clasp/projects/cando.


# Building

Please contact me about building Cando.  I'm working hard on developing it and I have limited time to help people build it.

More details coming...
