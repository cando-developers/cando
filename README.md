#CANDO - Computer Aided Nanostructure Design and Optimization
============

### FOR REVIEW PURPOSES ONLY - CANDO is currently a lot of trouble to build. Please don't disseminate this or publish on this until I get a chance to clean things up.

Cando is a computational chemistry environment for
building and designing functional molecules and materials.

It runs within the Clasp Common Lisp programming environment (github.com/drmeister/clasp).

It needs to be installed within clasp/projects/cando.


# Building

First build clasp - then to build the cando executable use:

```
clasp/projects/cando$  make
```

It will install cando_boehm_o. The cando executable will use the built Common Lisp image of Clasp.

More details coming very soon...
