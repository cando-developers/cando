Cando
============

Cando is a computational chemistry environment designed for building and designing functional molecules.

It runs within the Clasp Common Lisp programming environment (github.com/drmeister/clasp).

It needs to be installed within clasp/projects/cando.

# Building

First build clasp - then to build the cando executable use:

```
clasp/projects/cando$  make
```

It will install cando_boehm_o. The cando executable will use the built Common Lisp image of Clasp.
